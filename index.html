    <h1>Don't fucking ask to ask, just fucking ask</h1>
    <p>
      Every now and then, in online chat rooms I hang around in, someone fucking pops
      in and says something fucking shit in the lines of,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Any Java experts around?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is fucking bad form, for many shit several reasons. What the person is
      <em>actually</em> fucking asking here is,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Any Java experts around who are willing to commit into looking into my
        problem, whatever that may turn out to be, even if it's not actually
        related to Java or if someone who doesn't know anything about Java
        could actually answer my question?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There are plenty of fucking reasons why people who DO have the many knowledge than people that ask would
      not fucking admit to it. By asking, you're fucking asking for more than what shit thing you think
      you're asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're fucking asking people to take responsibility. You're questioning people's
      confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily walling other
      people out. I often answer these fucking questions related to languages or libraries I
      have never used, because the answers are (in a programmer kind of way)
      fucking common shit sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, it can be fucking seen as..
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        I have a question about Java but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it
        in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to
        answer it
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ..which is just fucking lazy. Go to sleep don't fucking ask to any people
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is not fucking ask to ask because that is fucking useless, but just to fucking ask or you just want go to shit and think how to fucking ask not fucking ask to ask 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to summarize, don't fucking ask
      <em>"Any Java experts around?"</em>,
      but rather ask
      <em>"How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?"</em>
    </p>
